## Tools used for the project

1. Excel - Excel for data inspection and preparation
2. PowerBI - Power BI for visualization and insight


## Visualization
Visualizations were done for the four pages (Products page, sales page, inventory page, and stores page). Images above are the visualizations of each pages. Below are the findings of the visualizations.


## Results and Findings

1. From the sales dashboard analysis, it was discorvered that in the year 2017 total sales for all quarters was 7.5 million and total profit was $2.19 million, while in the year 2018 the total sales foronly first, second and third quarters was 7.0 million and total profit was $1.82 million. This simply means that 2018 was on tract to be more profitable for the company that year 2017.
2. Also I found out that the toys category brought in the most sales and profit than the Arts & Craft, Electronics, Games, Sports & Outdoors categories.
3. The analysis also show that highest number of sales are archived in the third quarter of each year both 2017 and 2018, although spikes were observed in december due to the holiday season.


## Recommendations

- My recommendation is that the company should invest in social media and elctronic media advertising during third quarter and holiday seasons despite there are sales in these periods, there is still room for more sales.
- To boost the sales in other categories, ads of those category products should be carried out to increase sales and profits.


### Limitations

We could not analyze for the 4th quarter of 2018 due to limited data. Although I was able to predict higher sales and profits fir that period.
